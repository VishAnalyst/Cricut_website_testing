Feature: Verify "See what's possible with Cricut" carousel section

  As a Cricut website visitor
  I want to verify that the "How it works" section is displayed correctly
  So that I can ensure its content and scrolling functionality works as expected


  Scenario: Verify section heading and subheading exist
    Given I open the Cricut website for See what's possible with Cricut
    And I scroll down to the "See what's possible with Cricut" section for See what's possible with Cricut
    Then I should see the heading "See what's possible with Cricut." for See what's possible with Cricut
    And I should see the subheading "Discover perfectly personalized projects made by Cricut customers & get inspired for your making journey."

  Scenario: Verify initial 4 tabs load correctly
    Then I should see exactly 4 items in the "See what's possible with Cricut" carousel
    And the items should have the following content for whats possible:
      | Title (Alt text)                                                | Description                                                                                                                             |
